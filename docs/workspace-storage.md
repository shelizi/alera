# Workspace Storage

Alera measures a linked workspace on demand before offering manual cleanup. Measurement runs in a sidecar worker rather than on Flutter's main isolate or the terminal-host actor. Directory symlinks are counted but never followed.

Manual removal from the desktop always requires confirmation, including when the workspace is selected or has open tabs. Confirmation authorizes closing all tabs, stopping terminals and their child processes, and discarding unsaved changes. The desktop sends the additive `closeSessions: true` option with both storage measurement and managed removal. Callers that omit this option retain the refusal to remove a selected workspace or one with live terminal sessions.

Cleanup is still refused when the workspace is owned by an active automation definition or run, belongs to another host, is the main/source repository of any project, has another runtime owner, or resolves outside Alera's configured managed-workspace root. Once accepted, the runtime mutation barrier rejects new owner-creating requests until cleanup completes. Ownership, path containment, and Git worktree branch identity are checked again before stopping sessions and immediately before filesystem mutation. The runtime stops terminal process trees before removing the registered Git worktree and runtime records. A worker waits for process exit without blocking the host actor; on Unix it allows four seconds for graceful shutdown before escalating to SIGKILL, and on Windows it terminates and waits for the session Job Objects. Failure to verify shutdown prevents filesystem deletion. The desktop releases terminal scrollback buffers and editor documents. A failed Git operation leaves the workspace record available for a retry, but already stopped terminal tabs are removed and clients notified; stopped sessions are not restarted automatically. There is no scheduled or automatic cleanup.

If process shutdown fails, the running host retains the pending process identities or Windows handles between attempts and defers automatic idle shutdown. A confirmed retry checks those retained processes as well as any new sessions before deleting files. Legacy callers cannot bypass a pending shutdown by omitting `closeSessions` or removing its workspace/project records through another operation. On Unix, cleanup delays reaping the PTY leader to reserve its process identity while finding remaining members of its OS session, including helpers forked by shutdown handlers after their parents exit. This lease is released once shutdown is verified.

## Measurement Limitations

- Reported bytes are allocated entry lengths from filesystem metadata, not guaranteed physical disk usage. Sparse files, compression, deduplication, copy-on-write clones, filesystem block size, and hard links can make actual reclaimed space differ.
- Directory metadata contributes a small platform- and filesystem-dependent amount.
- Files changing during a scan can make the result approximate. The cleanup request rechecks ownership and path safety, but it does not freeze the filesystem.
- Unreadable or concurrently removed entries fail the scan instead of presenting a cleanup confirmation.
- Windows junctions and other reparse-point behavior depends on Rust's filesystem classification for the installed toolchain. Alera does not follow entries classified as symbolic links, and path containment is still checked using the platform canonical path.

## Workspace Sections

![Create or select a workspace section](images/workspace-section-picker.png)

Sections organize workspaces without moving files, changing projects or Parent relationships, or closing tabs and terminal sessions. Desktop and mobile share the section catalog, assignments, grouping preference, section sort, and collapse state through the paired runtime. Select **Section** in **Group By**, then use **Set Section** after the Parent actions on a workspace to select an existing section or create one when saving. **Clear Section** moves only that workspace to **Others**, the final group, which is hidden when empty.

Custom sections can mix projects. Parent nesting is displayed only within the same section. Pinned workspaces retain their dedicated group and the **Repeat Pinned Workspaces** preference. Sections support Name, Recent (membership changes), and Agent Activity sorting independently of workspace sorting. Searching a section name includes its members, while other filters continue to apply.

The Recent sort for projects and workspaces orders by last activity: opening a workspace, typing, pasting or submitting into its terminal (recorded at most once per 30 seconds per workspace), and agent state changes, with creation and renames still counting through `updatedAt`. A project ranks by its most recently active visible workspace. Activity times are kept per workspace by `WorkspaceActivityController`, which persists them to the runtime and the local database.

**Delete Section** requires confirmation and preserves every workspace. A section is removed automatically when its last member is moved, cleared, or removed, including through project removal. Filters, collapsed groups, and hiding pinned copies never remove assignments. Creating a section and assigning its initial workspace is atomic, so cancelling the dialog creates nothing. Names are trimmed, unique without case distinctions, and cannot be empty or **Others**. Sections belong to one runtime and are not synchronized between separate hosts.

The runtime stores sections and their single-workspace assignments separately from workspace upserts so older clients cannot overwrite membership. The additive **workspaceSectionsV1** capability gates section controls on desktop and mobile without changing either strict protocol version. Older hosts keep the existing None and Project controls.
